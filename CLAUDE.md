# My Life OS — Personal Life Operating System

> Formerly "Make My Life Structured." Renamed 2026-06-28 to reflect a wider scope: this is now the home for **anything in Alim's life** — health, family, finances, household, admin, faith, scheduling, and personal projects — not just coaching. The on-disk folder is now `My_Life_OS` and the GitHub repo is `alimpolat/my-life-os`; the Claude memory storage slug is unchanged, so all memory, skills, and agents carry over intact.

## Project Purpose
A personal life operating system for a 45-year-old AI engineer, father of three, working two jobs (Handelsbanken + ICON freelance), with a wife who works full-time as an engineer. It exists to bring **structure, health, energy, and rhythm** into life — and to act as a single trusted place to think through, track, and act on *anything* that comes up: medical letters and lab results, school and kommun admin, money, the household, faith and family rhythms, and whatever else life throws up. Life coaching (the agents below) is one part of it, not the whole.

## Family Profile
- **You**: 45M, AI Engineer at Handelsbanken (full-time) + ICON (freelance). Stressed, overworked, wants change.
- **Wife**: Full-time engineer. Shares the load of parenting and household.
- **Daughter (16)**: Teenager. Needs emotional presence, trust, and independence.
- **Son (11)**: Active, careless, loves Roblox. Needs boundaries, structure, and engagement.
- **Son (4)**: Very active toddler. Needs constant attention, play, and routine.

## Core Principles
1. **Small wins compound** - Don't try to fix everything at once. One habit at a time.
2. **Energy is the currency** - Without health and sleep, nothing else works.
3. **Structure creates freedom** - Routines reduce decision fatigue.
4. **Family is the mission** - Work serves the family, not the other way around.
5. **Progress over perfection** - A 70% day is better than a 0% day.

## Life Coach Agents
This project uses 5 specialized agents in `.claude/agents/`:

| Agent | Role | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| `health-coach.md` | Coach Marcus | Exercise, nutrition, body health, energy |
| `time-architect.md` | Architect Nadia | Daily/weekly schedules, routines, time blocking |
| `financial-advisor.md` | Advisor Ray | Budgeting, debt reduction, income strategy |
| `family-coach.md` | Coach Elena | Parenting, marriage, quality time, delegation |
| `energy-mindset.md` | Coach Kai | Sleep, stress, mindset, mental resilience |

## How to Use
- Run agents as a team for a full life review
- Run individual agents for focused coaching on one area
- Agents will produce actionable plans saved to `/plans/` directory
- Weekly review sessions recommended (Sunday evening, 30 min)

## Key Constraints
- Two jobs = limited free time. Plans must be realistic for ~1-2 hours/day of personal time.
- Financial pressure = solutions should be low-cost or free.
- Wife is a partner, not an assistant. Plans must distribute load fairly.
- Kids have different needs at different ages. No one-size-fits-all parenting.

## Output Format
All agent outputs should follow this structure:
1. **Current Reality** - Honest assessment
2. **Quick Wins** - Things to start this week (max 3)
3. **30-Day Plan** - Structured weekly progression
4. **90-Day Vision** - Where you'll be if you stick with it
5. **Daily Rituals** - Specific time-blocked actions
